# Fix Summary for Subscription Implementation

## Current Issues

1. StoreKit API compatibility issues:
   - Transaction.updates not found
   - Transaction.currentEntitlements not found

2. File structure issues:
   - Multiple @main declarations
   - Missing proper imports

## Fix Recommendations

1. Use StoreKit2 configuration:
   - Make sure you're using Xcode 14+ which supports StoreKit2
   - Follow Apple's new StoreKit API documentation

2. Simplified implementation for testing:
   - Create a basic placeholder app
   - Implement stub methods for subscription functionality
   - Use simulation methods for testing subscription features

3. Structure cleanup:
   - Have a single @main entry point
   - Properly import all required models
   - Follow SwiftUI best practices for environment objects

These changes should allow the app to compile and run for development while you complete the subscription implementation.
